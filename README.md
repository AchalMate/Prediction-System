# Prediction-System
In this project we have develop a System which predict the data or image available in the  dataset.Prediction system is a python based project which uses fashion_manist dataset to predict what  images actually contain. Fashion-MNIST can be used as drop-in replacement for the original MNIST  dataset.


For example is an image contain shoes image then it will predict that the input image is a 
shoes images with which type of shoes it contain i.e sneaker or formal shoes. For accuracy we use 
deep learning to train and build our model so that itâ€™s prediction is as accurate as human prediction.
Not only for product prediction we can train our model in such way that it can predict texts 
,audio , video etc 


Image Prediction or Image Classification is the task of assigning an input image, one label 
from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its 
simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications
